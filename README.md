# nnav — Notes Navigator

![Demo of nnav](demo2.gif)

> If you prefer taking notes in plain text or Markdown from the terminal, **nnav** makes it easy to browse and open them.

**nnav** is a fast, keyboard-driven **terminal UI (TUI)** for browsing your notes.
  
`nnav` scans your notes directory of plain-text or Markdown (`.txt`, `.md`) files and shows them in a collapsible tree.

The first Markdown heading (`# ...`) in each note is used as its description. If there is no Markdown heading, then the filename is displayed instead.

## ✨ Features

- Single binary, no dependencies
- Collapsible directory tree of your notes
- Supports `.md` and `.txt` files
- Shows the first Markdown heading as a description
- Vim-style keybindings (`h/j/k/l`, `q` to quit, etc.)
- Opens the selected note in your editor
- Config file at `~/.nnav` defines notes dir and editor:

```ini
notesdir=~/notes
editor=vim
```

- Create and organize your own tree of directories and plain text/Markdown notes. No databases, no proprietary formats, no vendor lock-in — just files you control
